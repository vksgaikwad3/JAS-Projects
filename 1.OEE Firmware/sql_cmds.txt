We find the 10 most populated cities. We order the data by population from the most populated to the least populated city. 
We limit the output with the LIMIT clause. 


mysql> SELECT Name, Population FROM City 
    -> ORDER BY Population ASC LIMIT 10;


mysql> CREATE TABLE First10 engine=MEMORY SELECT * FROM City LIMIT 10;

We create a temporary table in the memory. It will contain first ten cities from the City table.

	If you try to connect to a remote MySQL database from your client system, you will get the “Host is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server” message as shown below.

	$ mysql -h 192.168.1.8 -u root -p
	Enter password:
	ERROR 1130: Host '192.168.1.4' is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server

	You can also validate this by doing telnet to 3306 mysql port as shown below, which will also give the same “host is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server” error message.

	$ telnet 192.168.1.8 3306
	host 192.168.1.4 is not allowed to connect to this mysql server

	If you want to allow a specific client ip-address (for example: 192.168.1.4) to access the MySQL database running on a server, you should execute the following command on the server that is running the MySQL database.

	$ mysql -u root -p
	Enter password:

	mysql> use mysql

	mysql> GRANT ALL ON *.* to root@'192.168.1.4' IDENTIFIED BY 'your-root-password';

	mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
