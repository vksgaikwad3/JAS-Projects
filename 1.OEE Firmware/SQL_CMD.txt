If you want to allow a specific client ip-address (for example: 192.168.1.4) to access the MySQL database running on a server, you should execute the following command on the server that is running the MySQL database.

	$ mysql -u root -p
	Enter password:

	mysql> use mysql

	mysql> GRANT ALL ON *.* to root@'192.168.1.4' IDENTIFIED BY 'your-root-password';

	mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
